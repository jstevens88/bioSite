		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<hr/>
		
		<p id="bio">Alora Stevens is a 27 year old clinical manager from Murrieta, California. She lives with her husband 
		Jake, and two adorable kitties named Charlie and Graycie. She is interested in health and nutrition, 
		cooking, and true crime. Alora wanted to be an Animal Cop when she was little, and she uses that 
		passion for saving animals by maintaining a vegan lifestyle and educating anyone who will listen about 
		the cruelty of the meat and dairy industry. Her favorite travel destination is either the Dominican 
		Republic or Puerto Rico, two of the three countries she has visited outside the US (the third being 
		Mexico). She is also passionate about womenâ€™s rights and gender equality. She advanced from her initial 
		position of medical technician at her current job to clinical manager, where she enjoys helping people 
		and making a difference in their day to day lives. One of the valuable lessons she has learned in her 
		current profession is that not everyone can be pleased and some people just enjoy chaos. Alora brings 
		organization and problem solving to everything she does, as well as being detail oriented and 
		empathetic. She enjoys learning new things about health, anatomy, and medicine as a clinical manager, 
		but she is mostly passionate about making her patients feel comfortable and empowered. The biggest 
		influence on her life is her husband. He has made her a better person and helps her try to see the light in 
		life, even a world filled with so much darkness. He also pushes her to continue pursuing her goals, both 
		professionally and in life.
