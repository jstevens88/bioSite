					<p id="picture_description">Graycie is our first fur baby. She joined our family a little over four years ago. 
						Over the years she has adopted many names such as "Graycie girl" and "pretty lady". 
						She is a spoiled princess who knows she runs the house. Although she is an indoor cat, she has an adventurous spirit and will run out the front door at every opportunity. 
						We don't worry too much as she always comes running home if she hears a loud noise. 
						Her favorite place to be every night is cuddling with Alora demanding her pets.

					</figure>
					<p id="picture_description">Two years ago Alora decided to go vegan. She has always loved animals and when she learned more about the animal agriculture industry
					she could no longer stand idly by. Alora sees her food as a form of activism for the animals. 
					She even started an <a href="https://instagram.com/thestevenskitchen?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=" target="_blank">Instagram</a> 
					and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alorastevenss" target="_blank">TikTok</a>
					account to show others how eating a plant-forward diet can be fun and exciting. She does miss certain foods she used to enjoy. One of those foods is sushi!
					Alora decided one day that cucumber rolls were no longer cutting it and that she was going to make her own vegan sushi. She made vegan imitation crab using tofu and vegan tuna using marinated tomato.
					She even made her own vegan spicy mayo to go along with her rolls. Her delicious meals make it easy to eat more plant-based and she has inspired me to reduce my meat and dairy consumption as well!</p>

						<figcaption>(Charlie)</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p id="picture_description">Charlie is our second fur child. Also known as "Peanut" or "Charlie boy", he is the baby of our household. He almost always wants to be held, especially when either 
					of us get home from work. He will bury his face in a shoulder (always the left one) and purr as loud as he can. He is a very talkative cat that always makes it known that it's his turn for attention.
					We have also come to learn that he enjoys ice cream! Any time either of us has ice cream he comes running from across the house, ready to lick from the spoon if we let him.</p>
