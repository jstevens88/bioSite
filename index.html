			<h3>Inspiration</h3>
			<p id="intro">To gain a better understanding of my subject and her hobbies I looked into some articles regarding 
			health and nutrition, as well as looked into some reports about vegan food and how different it can be. 
			One of the major sources for my interview was actually a youtuber by the name of Alexandra 
			Andersson. She has tons of videos about what a day in the life of a vegan looks like as well as the 
			different types of food she eats throughout the day. I found it very interesting, as I try my best to limit 
			the amount of animal products I consume on a daily basis as well. Even though I’m not fully vegan, I 
			think being conscious about what I’m consuming is incredibly important. Alora is a huge inspiration to 
			me in this regard. I aspire to one day become fully vegan, so learning more about what that entails and 
			the struggles that go along with avoiding animal products was a big step in pushing me in that direction. 
			Alora is also interested in true crime. She recommended a podcast for me to listen to, and it turned out 
			to be incredibly interesting. I learned that most of these stories revolve around unsolved murders. While 
			that isn’t my usual cup of tea, I found it interesting that this type of content was enjoyable for her while 
			doing mundane tasks around the house or while cooking. Every day I aspire to be more like Alora. I hope 
			to one day be able to make tons of new vegan recipes with everything I’ve learned about how to be 
			better for our planet.
